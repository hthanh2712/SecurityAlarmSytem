\end{DoxyPre}


This function corrects the tick count value after the application code has held interrupts disabled for an extended period resulting in tick interrupts having been missed.

This function is similar to v\+Task\+Step\+Tick(), however, unlike v\+Task\+Step\+Tick(), x\+Task\+Catch\+Up\+Ticks() may move the tick count forward past a time at which a task should be removed from the blocked state. That means tasks may have to be removed from the blocked state as the tick count is moved.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em x\+Ticks\+To\+Catch\+Up} & The number of tick interrupts that have been missed due to interrupts being disabled. Its value is not computed automatically, so must be computed by the application writer.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
pd\+TRUE if moving the tick count forward resulted in a task leaving the blocked state and a context switch being performed. Otherwise pd\+FALSE. 
\end{DoxyReturn}
